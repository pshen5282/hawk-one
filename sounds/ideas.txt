kinds of chocolate
-----------------
sapphire chocolate: value decreases over time, timer is reset whenever bar is spawned
jade chocolate: value increases over time, capped at something, timer is reset when bar is spawned
wafer - bar value 25% more 
raw chocolate - value increases by how many different types of chocolate are in use in your bar

ADD A RESET BAR BUTTON SO U DONT SOFTLOCK URSELF
metal chocolate - 20hp , 50 val
caramel chocolate - decreases bar value by 20%, increases eating strength by 9
coconut chocolate - makes bar value 0% and kills you and kills yo uebcase ui hate coconut it sucks !important
