ideas!!
ok i found out how to add new lines
kinds of chocolate
-----------------
sapphire chocolate: value decreases over time, timer is reset whenever bar is spawned
jade chocolate: value increases over time, capped at something, timer is reset when bar is spawned
wafer - bar value 25% more 
raw chocolate - value increases by how many different types of chocolate are in use in your bar
peanut butter chocolate - increases bar value by 65%, decreases eating strength by 2
ADD A RESET BAR BUTTON SO U DONT SOFTLOCK URSELF
DONE metal chocolate - 20hp , 50 val
caramel chocolate - decreases bar value by 20%, increases eating strength by 9
coconut chocolate - 250% more bar value, adjacent chocolate value is 0
topaz chocolate - decreases bar value by 50%, 180 val, 6hp
mint chocolate - chocolate val is equal to 5 * log5(chocolate) 16hp
scary chocolate - jumpscare
seasalt chocolate - reduces bite strength by 0.25x (30 val)

suspicious chocolate - 50% chance to set next chocolate value to 0, 50% to give x3 multiplier to the next chocolate
explosive chocolate - 10% chance to automatically eat the next chocolate
scared chocolate - 25% chance everytime the eat button is pressed it disappears (10hp 40val)
melted chocolate - gives x1.25 more melted chocolate when eaten
dice chocolate - 5hp value is random from 0-99 every bar refresh
nuclear chocolate - x0.1 value for neighbooring chocolates, 60 val (halves every 2 times eat is clicked)
timed chocolate - 55 val but disappears after 1-3 (random) eat button is pressed
programmed chocolate - randomly steals the effects of a chocolate every eat (also logs "ow" on the conosle because funny :33333)
anti-chocolate - (-100 val, 10 hp) x2 adjacent chocolate
plated chocolate - 50 hp 125 val
boxed chocolate - 5hp 10val when eaten gives x1.75 bar and has a shield (absorbs all eat damage, forcing multiple hits) that lasts 1 time

reset one - melt 
melts your chocolate down into melts
it will also get rid of the chocolate in your inventory and replace them with milk
you have a max capcity of melts you can get per reset that will be upgraded later
with melts you are able to buy upgrades that last perminently

upgrade concepts
upgrade1 - shows more information about the chocolate values like value of your current bar and current chocolate
upgrade2 - allows extra damage from a click to carry over into the next chocolate
upgrade3 - increases chocolate gain by x1.25 (upgradable to 50) compounding
upgrade4 - increases base click damage by 1 per upgrade (uncapped)
upgrade5 - unlocks more bars you can buy
upgrade6 - gain a slider that can speed up or slow down time
